"Copy raw regex string to JS template, thanks to @s-weigand. This fixes "
"the way that the `copybutton_prompt_text` value is injected into "
"`copybutton.js_t` (as discussed in #86). The raw string formatting means "
"that backslashes are now propagated correctly and removes the need for "
"\"double escaping\". Users will need to update their "
"`copybutton_prompt_text` string accordingly."
